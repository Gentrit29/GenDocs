# Personal Note

This website is a first version of my personal documentation and course index. Its current content is limited, but it works well for tracking my learning and organizing resources.

I built this site to test Docusaurus, learn how documentation sites are structured, and create an archive for myself.

Over time, I will update it with new courses I take or resources I find useful. I decided to keep a window open for contributions, which I find a cool feature. Any feedback, or recommendations are welcome. For now the focus remains on my own learning and gradually expanding the content, which may take time.
