## Review

Solid course with clear explanations and strong project work. Best suited for learners who already have a good grasp of JavaScript, since the fundamentals section is brief. The projects are practical and can be extended to your own style, which helps reinforce concepts beyond coding along.

Not overly difficult, but expect to revisit some sections to fully absorb them. Overall, recommended for strengthening React fundamentals and getting an introduction to Next.js.
