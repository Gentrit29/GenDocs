## Course Overview

This course is very well made. In the course description it says that it's beginner friendly but I suggest to have strong fundamentals on JavaScript before going through this course.

The instructor will cover the basic concepts about JavaScript that you need to have in order to go on with the course (it's optional) like a quick breakthrough before going to advanced concepts.

## Projects

It has a lot of good projects that will help you build solid fundamentals and guide you thorugh good habits and patters that you should follow in order to keep your codebase clean and accessible for everyone.

Honestly, I followed the projects, coded along with him, but sometimes it gets a bit boring (it's subjective) so what I can suggest is not to skip to another lecture but instead go and make a project for yourself based on what you learned in the lecture or during the whole course, or maybe if you want to follow the project that the instructor is making, at least try to implement some new features or maybe make it on your own style.

## Difficulty / Level

I do think that it's not a difficult course, it explains a lot of concepts very well, sometimes I got lost through some concepts so I had to review them again but if you can stick with the flow, you can learn a lot.

This is subjective, it depends from person to person.

## Quick takeaway

I recommend this course to everyone that wants to strengthen their fundamentals about React and wants a quick introduction to Next.js.
