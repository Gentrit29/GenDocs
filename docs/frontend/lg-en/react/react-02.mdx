## Review

I took this course before [The Ultimate React Course 2025: React, Next.js, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course) and it gave me a strong foundation in React. It is very interactive and the instrucutor explains concepts clearly. I strongly recommend taking this course first,as it provides a solid base for more advanced React topics.
