## Review

The course provides a solid foundation in JavaScript. It includes many coding exercises (challenges) and a few projects, all of which are helpful. The lectures are well-structured. The difficulty depends on the individual's prior experience, but overall, it is a good starting point for becoming familiar with JavaScript.
