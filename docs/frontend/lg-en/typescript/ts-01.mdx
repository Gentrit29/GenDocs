## Review

This course is a beginner-friendly guide to integrating TypeScript into React projects. It provides practical examples and key concepts, making it easy to follow. TypeScript is a broad language, so no single video can cover everything about it. Depending on your situation, you may need to consult additional resources or [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for specific type definitions or advanced topics.
