# Introduction

Welcome to **GenDocs**.
This project began as a personal index of courses I have taken during my self-taught developer journey. I created it to keep track of resources I found useful, organized by category.

Although it started for my own use, I have decided to make it open so others can also browse the materials, or suggest new ones. If you know a course or resource worth adding, you can open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gentrit29/GenDocs).

## Disclaimer

<Disclaimer message="All course reviews and evaluations on this site reflect personal opinions and experiences. They are subjective and should not be considered definitive recommendations. Users are encouraged to conduct their own research and evaluate courses independently before making decisions." />

## Note

<Note message="If you want to share resources or feedback, create an issue or pull request on GitHub. I will review submissions when possible." />

## Project Purpose

- Serve as my structured archive of courses and learning resources.
- Provide an organized reference for anyone interested in similar paths.
- Allow contributions, so others can recommend courses per category (frontend, backend, version control, etc.).

The **main** scope is personal tracking first. Contributions such as resource suggestion or feedback are welcome, since they not only help me but also anyone who comes across this site.

## Navigation Overview

The courses are organized by category, with each main category having its own index page:

| Category | Description                                                               | Link                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Frontend | Courses on frontend development: JS, React, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, etc. | [Go](./category/frontend/) |
| Backend  | Courses on backend development: Node.js, Express, databases, etc.         | [Go](./category/backend/)  |
