# Contributing to GenDocs

This page provides instructions for adding new courses or resources to GenDocs.

## Course Contribution Template

When adding a new course, organize it in a category folder (e.g., `frontend` or `backend`), create subfolders per language (e.g., `lg-en` or `lg-it`), and within each language folder add the coding language, framework, or library (e.g., `typescript`, `javascript`, `react`). Each course should have individual `.mdx` files.

### Folder Structure Example

```bash
docs/
├─ frontend/
│ ├─ lg-en/
│ │ ├─ react/
│ │ │ ├─ react-01.mdx
│ │ │ └─ react-02.mdx
│ │ └─ typescript/
│ │   └─ ts-01.mdx
├─ backend/
│ ├─ lg-en/
│ │ ├─ javascript/
│ │ │ └─ nodejs-01.mdx
│ │ └─ express/
│ │   └─ ex-01.mdx
└─ resources.mdx
```
