# Introduction

Welcome to **GenDocs**.
This project began as a personal index of courses I have taken during my self-taught developer journey. I created it to keep track of resources I found useful, organized by category.

Although it started for my own use, I have decided to make it open so others can also browse the materials, or suggest new ones. If you know a course or resource worth adding, you can open an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/Gentrit29/GenDocs).

## Project Purpose

- Serve as my structured archive of courses and learning resources.
- Provide an organized reference for anyone interested in similar paths.
- Allow contributions, so others can recommend courses per category (frontend, backend, version control, etc.).

The **main** scope is personal tracking first. Contributions such as resource suggestion or feedback are welcome, since they not only help me but also anyone who comes across this site.
