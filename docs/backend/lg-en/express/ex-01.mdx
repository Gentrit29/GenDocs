## Review

This course follows the [Node.js Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32M1al-Y6Ag) and is also beginner-friendly and well-made. It provides a solid introduction to Express, one of the popular frameworks for Node.js. The instructor guides you through all the key concepts needed to start building a small backend for your projects. For deeper learning, consult the [official Express site](https://expressjs.com/) as it provides comprehensive resources.
